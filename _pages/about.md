I am a PhD student at the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Interactive AI at The University of Bristol. I'm currently in my foundational year which consists of taught modules covering a range of areas (machine learning, data science, NLP, uncertainty modelling). I'm currently researching project egocentric action recognition from audio with [Dr Dima Damen](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~damen/).

I've just completed my MSc in Data Science The University of Edinburgh. My [MSc thesis](https://github.com/DWhettam/FisherDistillation) was on network distillation. Specifically, modelling teacher architectures when given a student.
