I am a PhD student at the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Interactive AI at The University of Bristol. I'm currently in my foundational year which consists of taught modules covering a range of areas (machine learning, data science, NLP, uncertainty modelling). I'm also completing a reasearch project with Dr Dima Damen on egocentric action recognition from audio. 

I've just completed my MSc in Data Science The University of Edinburgh. My MSc thesis was on network distillation. Specifically, modelling teacher architectures when given a student.
