Education
======
* BSc. in Computer Science, The Univeristy of Hull, 2018
* MSc. in Data Science, The University of Edinburgh, 2019
* Ph.D in Interactive Artificial Intelligence, The University of Bristol, Present

### Research Experience
-------
* PhD Summer Project (Ongoing): ’The Blind Camera: Perception of Object Interaction Events from Audio Sensors’
  * Supervisors: Dima Damen, Vangelis Kazakos
  * I am researcing how to perform egocentric actionrecognition entirely from audio signals, in the context of the home-kitchen setting
* MSc Dissertation: ’Finding the Right Teacher for a Difficult Student’
  * Supervisors: Amos Storkey, Elliot J. Crowley
  * Investigated the use of Neural Architecture Search modelsfor network distillation, where a smaller student network approximates the learnt representation of a larger teacher network. Developed a novel approach to creating a teacher network for distillation using Fisher information to scale up a NAS model. I presented this work to some of the researchers in the Siri team at Apple.
* BSc Dissertation: ’Data Mining Over Cancer Data with Decision Support Tool’
  * I researched the use of clinical decision support systems for cancer diagnosis,ultimately developing a decision support tool to assist in bowel cancer diagnosis.

Work experience
======
* Summer 2018: Research Assistant
  * STFC Hartree Centre
  * Supervisor: Andrew Gargett
  * I researched applications of transfer learning for deep end-to-end speech recognition systems for use in assisted living environments. I used transfer learning to train RNN’s to recognise regional UK dialects. This work was accepted as an abstract and presented at the Interspeech 2019 workshop on Pluricentric Languages for Speech Technology
